## General Instructions to Install Python

1. Go to <https://www.python.org/>
1. Roll over the **Downloads** link on the top blue bar. You should get a button to download the version for your operating system.
1. Be sure to choose the latest Python version that starts with **`3.`**
1. Double-click the downloaded file to install. **Follow all instructions.**

### Mac users NOTE
At the end of the install, click on **Install Certificates** to install a set of current SSL root certificates. ([See screenshots.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Abq0U0BFuMygqpWpsek4q_3JKRC_fbQZRLKXTA_gvhk/edit#slide=id.g110b681bc66_0_9))

Mac users: You can click _yes_ when it asks to move the installer to the Trash.

### Windows users: 
Look carefully for any option to **“add Python to PATH”** - You DO want to do this — so if a box needs to be checked, **check it**.

If you need the step-by-step instructions on how to install your very first Python interpreter on a Windows machine, then read on. 

Skip to ["How to use IDLE with files?"](#how-to-use-idle-with-files) below if you are ready to get started with IDLE.
